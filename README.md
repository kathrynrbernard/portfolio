# Portfolio

This repository contains the code for my online portfolio. I used a Boostrap template and modified some of the styling elements using CSS to create a portfolio with 3 sections:

* A brief "About Me" section
* A portfolio section highlighting my remote sensing, GIS, and data visualization projects
* My resume
